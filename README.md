# TODO
- Consolidate all static content into a separate file and reference it from there.
- Implement a service for Axios and reuse it throughout the project.

# Run:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
